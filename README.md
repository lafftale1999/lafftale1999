## Hi there 👋

I'm **Carl**, an embedded systems developer based in Stockholm with a passion for **problem-solving, low-level programming, and real-time systems**.  
I enjoy building things from the ground up — whether that means getting LEDs to blink, designing hardware integrations, or implementing efficient backend logic.  

My main interests and skills include:  
- ⚡ Embedded systems & IoT  
- 💻 C, C++, and Java  
- 🕒 Real-time operating systems (FreeRTOS)  
- 🔐 Secure communication between hardware and backend systems  
- 🛠️ Hands-on hardware prototyping  

I’m driven by curiosity and the challenge of making complex systems both **reliable** and **efficient**.
