## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Carl. I'm 29 years old and lives in Stockholm, Sweden, and currently studying embedded development. Ever since I got an LED blink on the Arduino I've been stuck on embedded. At the moment I'm improving my skills in electrical engineering and deepening my understanding for components, circuits and design.

## Newly finished projects
Here are some of my newly finished projects:

**WSI Summer Internship**  
I've finished an internship at WSI and worked on an IoT system.
