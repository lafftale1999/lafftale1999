## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Carl. I'm 29 years old and lives in Stockholm. I'm specialized in embedded development and love to make things blink!

## Newly finished projects

### Pluto Payments
A lightweight credit card system with hardware, backend and frontend implementations. Build by me, [`Maksym`](https://github.com/Zar000) and [`Johann`](https://github.com/hager3737).
My contribution to this project was the hardware and backend logic for authorizing payments from the hardware layer. Also implementing mTLS between HW and BE.
